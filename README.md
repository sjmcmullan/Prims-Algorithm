# Prims-Algorithm
Prim’s algorithm to calculate the minimum spanning tree is of the order of O(n3). The algorithm Prim2 below performs the same function and is of order of O(n2). Implement this algorithm as part of a class and write a program to test this version of Prim’s algorithm. The test program should also compare the efficiency and results of this algorithm with the Prim’s algorithm contained in the course ebook by using the different size graphs.
